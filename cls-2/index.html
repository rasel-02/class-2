           <p>  Traffic jam is one of the most talked problems in our country. Traffic jam means a long line of vehicles
             stuck in jam. It is a common scene in big cities and towns. It has become a common affair for city people.
              It has created a deplorable condition in our regular life. <br> <br>

            There are many causes of traffic jams. Increasing the number of buses, trucks, autorickshaws,
             rickshaws are the main causes of traffic jams. Overpopulation is also a cause. This problem is getting
              worse day by day. All classes of people are the victim by it . <br> <br>
            
            Political leaders say that this problem will be solved soon after their party comes into power; but this
             problem still remains unsolved even after their coming into power. It is a problem not only in our country,
              but all over the world. <br> <br>

            
            The solution of this problem lies with us. We should be very careful while crossing roads and use
             lights when we cross roads at night time . Besides that we should encourage ourselves to co-operate
              with each other to help solve this problem. Since city people are victims by it, they must join hand
               together and find a permanent solution for this trouble. This can be done easily if we follow traffic
                rules strictly and use lights when we cross the roads at night time .
            
            So lets make up our mind today itself and try to avoid these problems in future in order to bring
             happiness and peace around us.</p>

             <h1> Neimar jr</h1>
             <h3> <b> 2010: Campeonato Paulista success</b> </h3>
             <img src="img/Neymar-Junior2.jpeg" alt="">
             <p> Neymar continued his ascendancy in 2010, and, on 15 April 2010, he scored five goals for Santos in an
               81 rout of Guarani in the qualifying stages of the Brazilian Cup.[31] Following the 2010 Campeonato 
               Paulista in which Neymar scored 14 goals in 19 games,[25] the club were crowned champions after a 5–5 
               aggregate win over Santo André in the finals.[32] Neymar was subsequently given the award for the best
                player in the competition.[33] Neymar's performances for Santos have drawn comparisons to other
                 Brazilians, including Robinho and Brazilian legend Pelé.[34]</p>

                 <p>In 2010, Santos rejected a £12 million bid for him from English Premier League team West Ham United,
                  [35] and later an offer from another English club, Chelsea, reported to be in the region of £20 million
                  .[36] Despite Santos unwillingness to sell and Neymar himself insisting "I'm focused only on Santos",
                  [37] his agent, Wagner Ribeiro, indicated that Neymar's career was elsewhere, stating "He wants to be
                  come the best player in the world. The chances of him doing that while playing in Brazil are zero."[36]
                   Although one year later Neymar admitted, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, that he had been
                    happy with Chelsea's interest in him as it was a "dream" of his "to play in Europe", while also 
                    stating that at the time it had been the right decision to stay in Brazil.[38] <br> <br>

                  On 30 November 2010, Santos sold a 5% share of future transfer fees that he would receive to an
                   investment group, Terceira Estrela Investimentos S.A. (TEISA), for R$ 3,549,900 (€1.5 million)
                   .[39] The previous year, his family had sold a 40% stake in Neymar's sporting rights to the DIS
                    Esporte group who had been a long-term strategic partner of Santos' football club.[40] <br> <br>
                  
                  Despite his first two seasons being highly successful, having ended the 2010 season with
                  an impressive 42 goals in 60 games, problems had been identified, namely Neymar's apparent
                  taste for diving when tackled, rather than attempting to continue his run, and his attitude.
                  The latter came to the forefront during a match with Atlético Goianiense, on 15 September
                  2010, when the Santos' manager, Dorival Júnior, appointed another player to take the penalty
                  awarded for a foul on Neymar. His decision was based on the fact that Neymar had missed a
                  crucial penalty during the Copa do Brasil final of that year, even if Santos went on to
                   win. Reacting to this, Neymar turned his back on his manager, had to be calmed down by 
                   a linesman and argued with his captain, Edu Dracena. The fallout from this event was
                   that Dorival Júnior wished to have Neymar suspended for two weeks, but the board 
                  sided with the player and promptly sacked the manager. Despite Neymar's apologies over the
                   incident, some doubts still remain about his attitude.[20] In December 2010, aged just 18
                  , Neymar came third for the 2010 South American Footballer of the Year, behind Andrés
                  D'Alessandro and Juan Sebastián Verón.[41]  </p>
